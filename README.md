# password-generator

## description:
The goal was to create a password generator that validates user input and randomly creates a password based upon the user's specifications. If possible, allow the user to copy the password to their clipboard by pressing a button. To enhance the UX for this functionality, I also wanted to add a tooltip to indicate that the selection has been copied.

## made in Visual Studio using:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
4. [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
5. [Popper.JS](https://popper.js.org/)

## final thoughts:
While I am familiar with coding logic insofar as objects, arrays, loops, and conditionals, I have considerably less experience with web development complexities of working with the DOM and the like. 

While the main part of this project was completed fairly quickly, I had some trouble implementing the tooltip with my limited knowledge of accessing elements in the DOM and jQuery. I definitely exercised the practice of reading documentation and trying to understand it in my own words.

Although I'm still a bit shaky on the intricacies of how frameworks are built, I am starting to feel more comfortable conceptualizing how to work with page elements and their attributes. 

Since I'm looking to build my front-end skills I know this is something I'm going to really have to engage with in order to get up to speed and I'm looking forward to focusing on it more in my next project.
